Source(s) for this assignment:

- All 4 PTs

Known problems with my code: None

Description: This assignment is the templated version of PA2-2. Everything works exactly the same as the
PA2-1 except for the fact that it can now accept any class as its data including float, string, etc. The
way I tested my class is the same as the PA2-1, all class member functions are called and I tried to break
my code as much as possible.
