Description: This assignment is an extension of PA1-1 with Collection class and more functions
for additional functionalities. Collection class is used to make a collection of Stress_ball
with its member functions used to make the user's life easier. In addition to rule of three, this
class also includes a move constructor and move assignment operator to increase efficiency. Each
element of the array can be called directly because [] operator is overloaded. The additional
functions outside the class include 3 ways of sorting the array by size, make a union of two 
collections, insert items into a collection through reading a data file, and print out every
element of the collection using cout with << operator being overloaded.
