Description: This assignment is the extension of PA2-2 via implementing a queue with linked list. Besides 
traditional enqueue and dequeue functionalities, the class also has min which returns the smallest value
in the queue and size is included for ease of use. All member functions are tested by calling each one
multiple times to ensure they work in as many cases as I can think of.
