Known problems with my code: None.

Description: This assignment is an introduction to linked list, specifically doubly linked list. The file has two
classes, one called DLListNode for constructing a node and DLList being the main class for making a linked list
using DLListNode. This program contains all necessary basic functions to make the data structure works as intended.
The way I tested my program was basically just call everything from the class and try to create some edge cases to
see how the class handles.
